This dataset is described in readme.md.

Your task is to create and execute scripts that explore this dataset and test various hypothesis and then summarize your findings in a new file report.md.

In report.md you can refer to any images that you create using markdown image elements.

Be sure to justify any conclusions using statistical tests.

Don't use the read tool on the source data files as they are too large.
