To understand the dataset and guide the analysis, I need to read the `readme.md` file, which likely contains a description of the data and potential hypotheses to test. This will help in designing scripts that perform the analysis and summarize results.

# Frontal‑Midline Theta and Working‑Memory Load

## Overview

This dataset captures the relationship between **theta‑band (4–7 Hz) neural oscillations** and **working‑memory (WM) load** during a continuous *n‑back* task. Twenty healthy adults performed alternating 0‑back and 3‑back blocks for 30 minutes while scalp EEG was recorded from 12 midline and near‑midline electrodes. Time‑resolved theta power was extracted every **500 ms** using complex‑Morlet wavelets, producing 3 600 samples per channel. WM load was indexed once per second by convolving block labels with a canonical impulse‑response kernel, yielding a smooth, continuous estimate of cognitive demand.

---

## Research Questions

* **Does frontal‑midline theta power track moment‑to‑moment fluctuations in WM load?**
* **Do multivariate theta patterns improve prediction of WM load compared with single‑channel measures?**

## Loading the Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load working‑memory load trace
gl_df = pd.read_csv("data/memory_load.csv")

# Load theta power data
th_df = pd.read_csv("data/theta_power.csv")

# Merge on shared time column for joint analyses
merged = gl_df.merge(th_df, on="time")
```

Time indices align exactly across files; merge on `time` to relate WM load to theta power.

The readme provides detailed information about the dataset and two main hypotheses to test:
1. Whether frontal‑midline theta power tracks momentary WM load.
2. Whether multivariate theta patterns provide better predictions of WM load compared to individual electrode measurements.

The next step is to create a Python script that will:
1. Load and merge the datasets.
2. Compute correlations between theta power (especially frontal-midline electrodes like Fz, FCz, Cz) and WM load.
3. Perform multivariate regression to predict WM load from all electrodes.
4. Perform statistical testing (e.g., Pearson correlation, regression significance).
5. Generate and save plots.

The multivariate model performed poorly with a negative R² value, indicating that it predicts worse than a mean predictor. This suggests that multivariate theta patterns do not improve WM load prediction. I will now compile all findings into a `report.md`, summarizing the univariate correlations and the failure of the multivariate regression approach, justifying them with the observed statistics and included figure.

# Report on Theta Power and Working Memory Load

## Objective

This analysis investigates the relationship between frontal‑midline theta-band power and working memory (WM) load using EEG data acquired during a continuous n-back task. Specifically, it addresses:

1. Whether frontal‑midline theta power reflects moment-to-moment WM load.
2. Whether multivariate theta measurements improve WM load prediction over single-channel measures.

## Findings

### 1. Frontal-Midline Theta Power and WM Load

We examined theta power at the electrodes Fz, FCz, and Cz, hypothesized to be central to WM-related activity. Each was tested for correlation with continuous WM load. The figure below illustrates these relationships:

![Frontal-Midline Theta vs WM Load](theta_vs_wm_load.png)

While there is a modest observable trend of increasing theta power with WM load, statistical tests (Pearson correlation) reveal weak or non-significant relationships across individual electrodes.

### 2. Multivariate Theta Prediction of WM Load

We trained a linear regression model using cross-validation to predict WM load from all 12 electrode theta signals. The resulting cross-validated R² score was poor:

```
Cross-validated R^2: -85.366 ± 169.628
```

This indicates that the multivariate model performed substantially worse than a simple baseline, providing no predictive advantage.

## Conclusion

- Momentary WM load is weakly correlated with theta power from frontal‑midline electrodes, but the effect is not strong or robust.
- Multivariate theta patterns do not enhance prediction accuracy and may introduce noise or overfitting.
