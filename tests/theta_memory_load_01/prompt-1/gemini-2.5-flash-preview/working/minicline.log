The user wants me to analyze a dataset related to memory load and theta power, described in `readme.md`.
I need to create and execute scripts to test hypotheses, summarize findings in `report.md`, and justify conclusions with statistical tests.
I should not use the `read_file` tool on `data/memory_load.csv` and `data/theta_power.csv` as they are too large.
I can refer to images created in `report.md`.

Plan:
1. Read `readme.md` to understand the dataset and potential hypotheses.
2. Create a Python script to analyze the data. This script should:
    - Load `data/memory_load.csv` and `data/theta_power.csv` (using a library that can handle large files, like pandas with chunking if necessary, although the prompt says not to read, it likely means not to read *with the read_file tool* not that I can't use a script to read it). I will use pandas.
    - Perform some exploratory data analysis.
    - Test a hypothesis about the relationship between memory load and theta power using a statistical test (e.g., correlation, t-test, or regression).
    - Potentially generate plots to visualize the data and results.
    - Save the results and any plots.
3. Execute the Python script.
4. Create `report.md` to summarize the findings, including the hypothesis tested, methods, results, and conclusion. Include references to any generated images.
5. Use `attempt_completion` to present the `report.md`.

Let's start by reading `readme.md`.

# Frontal‑Midline Theta and Working‑Memory Load

## Overview

This dataset captures the relationship between **theta‑band (4–7 Hz) neural oscillations** and **working‑memory (WM) load** during a continuous *n‑back* task. Twenty healthy adults performed alternating 0‑back and 3‑back blocks for 30 minutes while scalp EEG was recorded from 12 midline and near‑midline electrodes. Time‑resolved theta power was extracted every **500 ms** using complex‑Morlet wavelets, producing 3 600 samples per channel. WM load was indexed once per second by convolving block labels with a canonical impulse‑response kernel, yielding a smooth, continuous estimate of cognitive demand.

---

## Research Questions

* **Does frontal‑midline theta power track moment‑to‑moment fluctuations in WM load?**
* **Do multivariate theta patterns improve prediction of WM load compared with single‑channel measures?**

## Loading the Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load working‑memory load trace
gl_df = pd.read_csv("data/memory_load.csv")

# Load theta power data
th_df = pd.read_csv("data/theta_power.csv")

# Merge on shared time column for joint analyses
merged = gl_df.merge(th_df, on="time")
```

Time indices align exactly across files; merge on `time` to relate WM load to theta power.

I have read `readme.md`.
The dataset contains `memory_load.csv` (time and wm_load) and `theta_power.csv` (time and theta power for 12 electrodes).
The research questions are:
1. Does frontal-midline theta power track moment-to-moment fluctuations in WM load?
2. Do multivariate theta patterns improve prediction of WM load compared with single-channel measures?

I will focus on the first research question for now: Does frontal-midline theta power track moment-to-moment fluctuations in WM load?
I can address this by examining the correlation between `wm_load` and the theta power of frontal-midline electrodes (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz). I will also include Fpz as it's a frontal-midline electrode mentioned in the list.

Steps:
1. Create a Python script `analyze_data.py`.
2. The script will load `memory_load.csv` and `theta_power.csv` using pandas, as shown in the `readme.md`.
3. Calculate the correlation between `wm_load` and the theta power of Fpz, Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, and Pz electrodes.
4. Perform a statistical test to determine the significance of the correlations (e.g., using `scipy.stats.pearsonr`).
5. Save the correlation results.
6. Execute the Python script.
7. Create `report.md` summarizing the findings.

I have executed `analyze_data.py` and got the correlation results.
The script calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and the p-value between 'wm_load' and the theta power for several frontal-midline electrodes.

Results:
- theta_Fpz: Correlation = -0.0981, P-value = 0.0000
- theta_Fz: Correlation = -0.0306, P-value = 0.0660
- theta_FCz: Correlation = 0.0704, P-value = 0.0000
- theta_Cz: Correlation = 0.1058, P-value = 0.0000
- theta_CPz: Correlation = 0.0057, P-value = 0.7327
- theta_Pz: Correlation = 0.0230, P-value = 0.1671

Most of the frontal-midline electrodes show a statistically significant correlation with WM load (p < 0.05), except for theta_Fz, theta_CPz, and theta_Pz.
The correlations are generally weak, both positive and negative, depending on the electrode. Theta_Cz shows the strongest positive correlation, while theta_Fpz shows the strongest negative correlation among the tested electrodes.

Now I need to create the `report.md` file to summarize these findings.

# Report on Frontal-Midline Theta and Working Memory Load

## Introduction

This report summarizes an exploratory analysis of the relationship between frontal-midline theta power and working memory (WM) load using the provided dataset. The dataset contains time-series data for WM load and theta power recorded from various electrodes during a continuous n-back task.

The primary research question addressed in this analysis is whether frontal-midline theta power tracks moment-to-moment fluctuations in WM load.

## Methods

Data from `data/memory_load.csv` and `data/theta_power.csv` were loaded and merged based on the `time` column. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the linear relationship between the continuous working memory load index (`wm_load`) and the theta power from selected frontal-midline electrodes (Fpz, Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz). The p-value for each correlation was calculated to assess statistical significance.

The analysis was performed using a Python script (`analyze_data.py`) utilizing the pandas library for data handling and scipy.stats for correlation and p-value calculation.

## Results

The Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between WM load and theta power for the selected frontal-midline electrodes are as follows:

*   **theta_Fpz:** Correlation = -0.0981, P-value = 0.0000
*   **theta_Fz:** Correlation = -0.0306, P-value = 0.0660
*   **theta_FCz:** Correlation = 0.0704, P-value = 0.0000
*   **theta_Cz:** Correlation = 0.1058, P-value = 0.0000
*   **theta_CPz:** Correlation = 0.0057, P-value = 0.7327
*   **theta_Pz:** Correlation = 0.0230, P-value = 0.1671

A significance level of p &lt; 0.05 was used for this analysis. The results indicate statistically significant correlations between WM load and theta power at electrodes Fpz, FCz, and Cz. The correlations are relatively weak, with both negative (Fpz) and positive (FCz, Cz) relationships observed. Electrodes Fz, CPz, and Pz did not show a statistically significant correlation with WM load in this analysis.

## Conclusion

Based on the Pearson correlation analysis, there is evidence that theta power at certain frontal-midline electrodes (Fpz, FCz, and Cz) is associated with fluctuations in working memory load. However, the observed correlations are weak, suggesting that while there might be a relationship, it is not a strong linear one across all tested frontal-midline sites. electrode-specific differences were observed, with some electrodes showing significant correlations while others did not.

Further analysis, potentially employing time-series specific methods or exploring non-linear relationships, could provide deeper insights into how frontal-midline theta activity tracks working memory load. Investigating multivariate patterns, as suggested in the original research questions, could also reveal more complex relationships.

I have created the `report.md` file summarizing the findings from the correlation analysis.
I have addressed the first research question by calculating and interpreting the correlations between WM load and frontal-midline theta power, justifying conclusions with statistical tests (p-values).
I have also referred back to the `analyze_data.py` script used for the analysis.
I have not generated any images, so there are no image references to include at this time.
The task of creating and executing scripts to explore a hypothesis and summarizing findings in `report.md` is complete.

Now I will use `attempt_completion` to present the `report.md` to the user.
