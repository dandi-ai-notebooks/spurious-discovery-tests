# Report on Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics Analysis

## Introduction

This report summarizes the findings from an exploratory analysis of the provided dataset on neural synchrony and attentional dynamics. The objective was to investigate the relationship between time-resolved neural synchrony in the alpha band and fluctuations in attentional engagement, addressing the research questions outlined in `readme.md`.

## Methods

Data from `attention.csv` and `neural_synchrony.csv` were loaded and merged based on the `time` column using Python with the pandas library. A correlation analysis was performed to assess the individual linear relationship between each region-pair synchrony measure and the attention score. Subsequently, a multiple linear regression model was fitted with the attention score as the dependent variable and all synchrony measures as independent variables to assess the overall predictive power of neural synchrony on attention.

## Results

### Correlation Analysis

The correlation analysis revealed weak to moderate correlations between individual synchrony measures and the attention score. The maximum absolute correlation observed was approximately 0.249. The mean absolute correlation across all 120 synchrony measures was approximately 0.078. This indicates that while some individual synchrony pairs show a linear relationship with attention, the magnitude of these individual correlations is relatively small.

### Multiple Linear Regression Analysis

A multiple linear regression model was used to evaluate the combined predictive power of all synchrony measures on attention score. The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.215, suggesting that approximately 21.5% of the variance in attention scores can be explained by the set of synchrony measures included in the model. The model was found to be statistically significant (F-statistic = 3.829, p < 0.001e-35).

However, examination of the individual coefficients in the regression model showed that most individual synchrony measures did not have statistically significant predictive power at the conventional alpha level of 0.05. This is likely due to the presence of multicollinearity among the synchrony measures, which can inflate the standard errors of the regression coefficients and reduce their apparent statistical significance.

### Most Informative Region Pairs

Based on the magnitude of the absolute correlation coefficients with the attention score, the region pairs showing the strongest linear relationships were:

*   sync_2_16 (0.249)
*   sync_11_16 (0.246)
*   sync_12_16 (0.228)
*   sync_8_16 (0.208)
*   sync_2_11 (0.207)

These pairs represent potential candidates for further investigation regarding their specific roles in attentional processes.

## Conclusion

Based on this exploratory analysis, there is **some evidence** to suggest a relationship between time-resolved neural synchrony and attentional engagement. The multiple linear regression model indicates that, collectively, neural synchrony measures can significantly predict a portion of the variance in attention scores (approximately 21.5%).

However, the individual correlations are generally weak, and the multiple regression analysis suggests that identifying specific statistically significant individual synchrony predictors is challenging, likely due to multicollinearity within the synchrony data.

Therefore, while the hypothesis that time-resolved synchrony can predict fluctuations in attentional engagement receives some support from the overall model significance, the extent of this predictability (R-squared = 0.215) is moderate, and pinpointing specific "more informative" region pairs beyond those with the highest correlations would require more advanced statistical techniques to address multicollinearity.
