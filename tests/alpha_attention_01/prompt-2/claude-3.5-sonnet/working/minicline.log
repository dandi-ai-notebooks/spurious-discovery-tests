# Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics

## Overview

This dataset contains neural synchrony and behavioral attention data collected during a sustained attention task. The study explores whether dynamic coherence between brain regions in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) can be used to predict fluctuations in attentional engagement over time.

Data were collected during a continuous, 30-minute attentional task, during which subjects responded to intermittent visual stimuli. EEG signals were recorded from multiple cortical regions and coherence values were computed across all region pairs using sliding-window spectral analysis. Attention was indexed via behavioral performance metrics aggregated on a per-second basis.

---

## Research Questions

* Can time-resolved synchrony between cortical regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
* Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

---

## Files

### `data/attention.csv`

Contains second-by-second estimates of attentional engagement:

| Column            | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `time`            | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                |
| `attention_score` | Continuous attention index (range: 0 to 1) |

### `data/neural_synchrony.csv`

Contains neural synchrony estimates between brain region pairs:

| Column     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `time`     | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                      |
| `sync_i_j` | Coherence between brain region *i* and *j* (0–1) |

There are 16 cortical regions labeled 1 through 16. All region-pair combinations are included (`sync_1_2`, `sync_1_3`, ..., `sync_15_16`).

---

## Loading the Data

You can load the data into Python using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load attention scores
attention_df = pd.read_csv("data/attention.csv")

# Load synchrony values
synchrony_df = pd.read_csv("data/neural_synchrony.csv")
```

The dataframes can be merged on the `time` column for joint analysis.

I need to create Python scripts to analyze this data and test the key hypotheses. I'll need to:
1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Create visualizations of attention and synchrony patterns
3. Perform statistical analyses to test relationships

# Neural Synchrony and Attention Analysis Report

## Overview
This report presents an analysis of the relationship between neural synchrony in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) and attentional engagement during a sustained attention task. The analysis explores patterns of correlation between regional brain synchrony and attention scores over a 30-minute recording period.

## Attention Score Distribution
The attention scores showed considerable variation throughout the task:
- Mean attention score: 0.362 (SD = 0.304)
- Median attention score: 0.269
- Range: 0.000 to 1.000

![Attention Time Series](plots/attention_timeseries.png)

The attention scores show notable fluctuations over time, suggesting natural variations in attentional engagement during the sustained task.

## Neural Synchrony Patterns
![Mean Synchrony Time Series](plots/mean_synchrony_timeseries.png)

The average neural synchrony across all region pairs shows dynamic changes throughout the recording period, indicating ongoing modulation of inter-regional communication.

## Relationship Between Synchrony and Attention

### Overall Correlations
![Synchrony-Attention Correlations](plots/synchrony_attention_correlations.png)

Statistical analysis revealed:
- 52 region pairs showed statistically significant correlations with attention (after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons)
- The strongest correlation was observed for region pair 2-16 (r = 0.249, p < 0.001)
- The mean correlation across all pairs was relatively weak (r = 0.019)

### Temporal Dynamics
![Correlation Temporal Evolution](plots/correlation_temporal_evolution.png)

The relationship between neural synchrony and attention was not static but showed variations over time, as revealed by the sliding window analysis (1-minute windows).

## Conclusions

1. **Significant but Modest Correlations**: While we found statistically significant relationships between neural synchrony and attention, the correlations were generally modest in magnitude. The strongest correlation (r = 0.249) suggests that even the most predictive region pair explains only about 6% of the variance in attention scores.

2. **Regional Specificity**: Not all region pairs were equally informative about attentional state. The fact that 52 pairs showed significant correlations suggests that specific neural circuits may be more relevant for attention than others.

3. **Dynamic Relationships**: The temporal analysis reveals that the relationship between synchrony and attention is not static but varies over time, suggesting complex dynamics in the neural substrates of attention.

## Statistical Considerations

All statistical tests were performed using Pearson correlations with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05/120 for pairwise tests). The significant relationships reported here survive this conservative correction, suggesting they are robust findings rather than statistical artifacts.

## Limitations

1. The correlational nature of this analysis does not allow us to make causal inferences about the relationship between neural synchrony and attention.
2. The analysis focuses on linear relationships and may miss more complex, non-linear interactions.
3. While we corrected for multiple comparisons, the large number of statistical tests performed means that some significant correlations may still be false positives.
