I see that there are two data files: data/attention.csv and data/neural_synchrony.csv. I also see a readme.md file, which likely contains descriptions of the dataset, its columns, and possibly some ideas for hypotheses to test. Importantly, I am instructed not to use the read_file tool on these large data files directly. Instead, I should create and execute scripts to perform the data exploration and hypothesis testing.

The task involves:
1. Reviewing readme.md to understand the datasets, to formulate hypotheses, and to know which statistical tests/plots might be relevant.
2. Creating exploratory and statistical scripts (likely in Python using pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, or seaborn).
3. Executing those scripts step by step.
4. Creating `report.md` that summarizes the process and results, referencing any generated images.

The best starting point is to read `readme.md` to understand the available data, columns, and research context.

# Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics

## Overview

This dataset contains neural synchrony and behavioral attention data collected during a sustained attention task. The study explores whether dynamic coherence between brain regions in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) can be used to predict fluctuations in attentional engagement over time.

Data were collected during a continuous, 30-minute attentional task, during which subjects responded to intermittent visual stimuli. EEG signals were recorded from multiple cortical regions and coherence values were computed across all region pairs using sliding-window spectral analysis. Attention was indexed via behavioral performance metrics aggregated on a per-second basis.

---

## Research Questions

* Can time-resolved synchrony between cortical regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
* Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

---

## Files

### `data/attention.csv`

Contains second-by-second estimates of attentional engagement:

| Column            | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `time`            | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                |
| `attention_score` | Continuous attention index (range: 0 to 1) |

### `data/neural_synchrony.csv`

Contains neural synchrony estimates between brain region pairs:

| Column     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `time`     | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                      |
| `sync_i_j` | Coherence between brain region *i* and *j* (0–1) |

There are 16 cortical regions labeled 1 through 16. All region-pair combinations are included (`sync_1_2`, `sync_1_3`, ..., `sync_15_16`).

---

## Loading the Data

You can load the data into Python using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load attention scores
attention_df = pd.read_csv("data/attention.csv")

# Load synchrony values
synchrony_df = pd.read_csv("data/neural_synchrony.csv")
```

The dataframes can be merged on the `time` column for joint analysis.

The readme.md explains the structure of the two main datasets:
- `data/attention.csv`: Time series of "attention_score" (0–1) per second for 30 minutes (1800 seconds).
- `data/neural_synchrony.csv`: For each second, coherence values (sync_i_j, 0–1) for all pairs out of 16 regions.

Primary research questions:
1. Can time-resolved synchrony between brain regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
2. Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

Exploration and analysis steps:
1. Create a script to read, merge, and give a general overview (means/SD/correlations) of attention and synchrony.
2. Investigate if coherence of specific region pairs predicts attention (correlation, regression, feature importance).
3. Test: Are some region pairs significantly more correlated with attention_score?
4. Generate visually informative figures (e.g., time series plots, correlation heatmaps, feature importances) and save as files.
5. Statistically test (correlation p-values; possibly more, depending on findings).
6. Document all findings and approaches in report.md with proper references to generated images.

I’ll first create an analysis script to accomplish steps 1–3 and save results and images. I’ll start with a Python script named explore_and_analyze.py.

I've created the analysis script (explore_and_analyze.py), which:
- Loads and merges data.
- Plots attention time series.
- Calculates Pearson correlations between all synchrony pairs and attention, plots a heatmap, writes top/bottom correlations, and lists statistically significant pairs after Bonferroni correction.
- Plots attention score histogram.

The next step is to execute this script so it can generate the figures (attention_timeseries.png, sync_attention_corr_heatmap.png, attention_histogram.png) and the result files (top_sync_correlations.txt, significant_sync_pairs.txt) for use in the final report.

The analysis script ran successfully and generated six new files:
- Figures: attention_histogram.png, attention_timeseries.png, sync_attention_corr_heatmap.png
- Results: top_sync_correlations.txt, significant_sync_pairs.txt

Next, I need to synthesize the findings into report.md. To accurately summarize, I need the content of top_sync_correlations.txt (top and bottom correlated region pairs with attention) and significant_sync_pairs.txt (statistically significant correlations after Bonferroni correction). I will start by reading top_sync_correlations.txt to summarize the strongest region-pair relationships.

The top correlations between neural synchrony and attention scores are modest but statistically significant, with region pairs like sync_2_16 (r=0.249), sync_11_16 (r=0.246), and sync_12_16 (r=0.228) leading. The lowest correlations are near zero (e.g., sync_1_4 at r ≈ 0).

Next, I will check significant_sync_pairs.txt, which lists region pairs showing significant correlation with attention after Bonferroni correction. This will clarify which (if any) results are robustly significant. Then, I can synthesize and write the main findings and link to the generated plots in report.md.

There is strong statistical evidence (after stringent Bonferroni correction) that several region pairs' synchrony values are correlated with attention scores, as indicated by significant region pairs like sync_2_16, sync_11_16, sync_12_16, and both positively and negatively correlated pairs (many with |r| > 0.1). The magnitudes are moderate, but findings are not likely due to chance.

The script also generated key visual figures (attention score time series, histogram, correlation heatmap), which should be referenced in the report for transparency and illustration.

I will now draft report.md to:
- State the research questions.
- Summarize methodology and statistical approach.
- Reference and briefly describe the generated figures.
- Highlight and interpret the main findings with justification, including mention of the Bonferroni-corrected significant results.
- Note the effect sizes and context (moderate, but robust correlations).
- Conclude by discussing whether the neural synchrony meaningfully predicts attention according to the evidence, and whether any region pairs stand out.

References to figures will use standard markdown image elements.

# Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics: Data Exploration and Hypothesis Testing

## Research Questions

- Can time-resolved synchrony between cortical regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
- Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

## Methods

We analyzed second-by-second neural synchrony between all pairs of 16 cortical regions (alpha frequency band coherence, 0–1) and behavioral attention scores (range 0–1) over a 30-minute continuous task. Data exploration included:
- Visualization of attention time course and distribution.
- Computation of Pearson correlations between each region-pair synchrony and attention.
- Visualization of correlations as a matrix heatmap.
- Multiple testing correction (Bonferroni) across all region pairs.

All statistical procedures were conducted in Python using pandas, scipy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Results

### Attention Score: Time Course and Distribution

![](attention_timeseries.png)

*Time series of attentional engagement over the course of the experiment.*

![](attention_histogram.png)

*Histogram showing the distribution of attention scores (range 0–1) over all samples.*

### Neural Synchrony and Attention: Correlation Patterns

![](sync_attention_corr_heatmap.png)

*Pearson correlation coefficients between attention score and synchrony for each region pair (upper triangle only, 16×16).* 

The correlation coefficients range from approximately -0.17 to +0.25. The strongest positive correlation with attention was found for synchrony between regions 2 and 16 (**r = 0.25, p ≈ 6×10⁻²⁷**), with several other region-pairs (e.g., 11–16, 12–16, 8–16, 2–11) also showing moderate positive correlations (r > 0.15). Negative correlations were weaker but notable, with region pairs such as 5–15 (**r = -0.17, p ≈ 1×10⁻¹³**) exhibiting the largest negative association.

### Statistical Significance and Multiple Testing

After applying stringent Bonferroni correction, **many region pairs** remained significantly correlated with attention (see table below for selected examples):

| Region Pair | Correlation (r) | p-value |
|-------------|----------------:|--------:|
| 2–16        | 0.25            | 6.0e-27 |
| 11–16       | 0.25            | 3.3e-26 |
| 12–16       | 0.23            | 1.4e-22 |
| 5–15        | -0.17           | 1.2e-13 |
| 13–15       | -0.17           | 8.7e-13 |
| 2–8         | 0.17            | 1.1e-12 |
| ...         | ...             | ...     |

(For the complete list, see the file *significant_sync_pairs.txt*.)

### Summary and Interpretation

- Specific synchrony measures, particularly involving region 16 with regions 2, 11, 12, and 8, **robustly predict attentional engagement** with moderate effect sizes.
- Other region pairs display weak or negligible correlations, indicating substantial specificity in the neural correlates of attention in this paradigm.
- All findings are justified by significant p-values after correcting for multiple region-pair comparisons.

## Conclusion

We find statistically robust, albeit moderate, relationships between dynamic cortical synchrony and attentional engagement. The results suggest that **coherence between specific regions (notably those involving region 16) is a meaningful neural correlate of attention** in this context.

No evidence was found for strong negative correlations, and many region pairs show little or no association.
