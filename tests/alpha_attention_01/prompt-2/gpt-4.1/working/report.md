# Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics: Data Exploration and Hypothesis Testing

## Research Questions

- Can time-resolved synchrony between cortical regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
- Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

## Methods

We analyzed second-by-second neural synchrony between all pairs of 16 cortical regions (alpha frequency band coherence, 0–1) and behavioral attention scores (range 0–1) over a 30-minute continuous task. Data exploration included:
- Visualization of attention time course and distribution.
- Computation of Pearson correlations between each region-pair synchrony and attention.
- Visualization of correlations as a matrix heatmap.
- Multiple testing correction (Bonferroni) across all region pairs.

All statistical procedures were conducted in Python using pandas, scipy, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Results

*Pearson correlation coefficients between attention score and synchrony for each region pair (upper triangle only, 16×16).* 

The correlation coefficients range from approximately -0.17 to +0.25. The strongest positive correlation with attention was found for synchrony between regions 2 and 16 (**r = 0.25, p ≈ 6×10⁻²⁷**), with several other region-pairs (e.g., 11–16, 12–16, 8–16, 2–11) also showing moderate positive correlations (r > 0.15). Negative correlations were weaker but notable, with region pairs such as 5–15 (**r = -0.17, p ≈ 1×10⁻¹³**) exhibiting the largest negative association.

### Statistical Significance and Multiple Testing

After applying stringent Bonferroni correction, **many region pairs** remained significantly correlated with attention (see table below for selected examples):

| Region Pair | Correlation (r) | p-value |
|-------------|----------------:|--------:|
| 2–16        | 0.25            | 6.0e-27 |
| 11–16       | 0.25            | 3.3e-26 |
| 12–16       | 0.23            | 1.4e-22 |
| 5–15        | -0.17           | 1.2e-13 |
| 13–15       | -0.17           | 8.7e-13 |
| 2–8         | 0.17            | 1.1e-12 |
| ...         | ...             | ...     |

### Summary and Interpretation

- Specific synchrony measures, particularly involving region 16 with regions 2, 11, 12, and 8, **robustly predict attentional engagement** with moderate effect sizes.
- Other region pairs display weak or negligible correlations, indicating substantial specificity in the neural correlates of attention in this paradigm.
- All findings are justified by significant p-values after correcting for multiple region-pair comparisons.

## Conclusion

We find statistically robust, albeit moderate, relationships between dynamic cortical synchrony and attentional engagement. The results suggest that **coherence between specific regions (notably those involving region 16) is a meaningful neural correlate of attention** in this context.

No evidence was found for strong negative correlations, and many region pairs show little or no association.
