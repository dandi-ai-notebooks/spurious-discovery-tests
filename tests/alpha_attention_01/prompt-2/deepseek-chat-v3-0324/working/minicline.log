First, I need to understand the dataset by reading the readme.md file to get information about the data structure and potential hypotheses to test. Since the data files are too large to read directly, I'll need to use command-line tools to explore them statistically.

The task requires:
1. Exploring the dataset (likely using command-line tools like awk, wc, etc.)
2. Testing hypotheses (likely using statistical tools like Python/R scripts)
3. Creating visualizations
4. Writing a report with findings

I'll start by examining the readme to understand what's in the data files and what analyses might be appropriate.

# Neural Synchrony and Attentional Dynamics

## Overview

This dataset contains neural synchrony and behavioral attention data collected during a sustained attention task. The study explores whether dynamic coherence between brain regions in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) can be used to predict fluctuations in attentional engagement over time.

Data were collected during a continuous, 30-minute attentional task, during which subjects responded to intermittent visual stimuli. EEG signals were recorded from multiple cortical regions and coherence values were computed across all region pairs using sliding-window spectral analysis. Attention was indexed via behavioral performance metrics aggregated on a per-second basis.

---

## Research Questions

* Can time-resolved synchrony between cortical regions predict fluctuations in attentional engagement?
* Are specific region-pair connections more informative than others?

---

## Files

### `data/attention.csv`

Contains second-by-second estimates of attentional engagement:

| Column            | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `time`            | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                |
| `attention_score` | Continuous attention index (range: 0 to 1) |

### `data/neural_synchrony.csv`

Contains neural synchrony estimates between brain region pairs:

| Column     | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `time`     | Time in seconds (0 to 1799)                      |
| `sync_i_j` | Coherence between brain region *i* and *j* (0–1) |

There are 16 cortical regions labeled 1 through 16. All region-pair combinations are included (`sync_1_2`, `sync_1_3`, ..., `sync_15_16`).

---

## Loading the Data

You can load the data into Python using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load attention scores
attention_df = pd.read_csv("data/attention.csv")

# Load synchrony values
synchrony_df = pd.read_csv("data/neural_synchrony.csv")
```

The dataframes can be merged on the `time` column for joint analysis.

Based on the readme, we have two datasets:
1. attention.csv - time series of attention scores
2. neural_synchrony.csv - time series of synchrony between 16 brain regions

Key research questions are about relationship between synchrony and attention.

Next steps:
1. First explore basic statistics of both datasets (row counts, value ranges)
2. Then write a Python script to analyze correlations between synchrony and attention
3. Create visualizations
4. Generate report.md with findings

Since we can't read the large files directly, we'll use command-line tools first to explore basic statistics.

Both files have 1801 lines (1800 data points + 1 header line), matching the 30-minute (1800 second) duration mentioned in the readme.

Next, I'll check the range of values in both files to understand the data distribution. For attention.csv, we'll look at the attention_score column. For neural_synchrony.csv, we'll check the sync columns.

The attention scores range from 0.0 to 8.1e-6, which seems unusually small compared to the readme's stated range of 0 to 1. This suggests either:
1. The data is normalized differently than described
2. There might be an issue with the data

Next, I'll check the range of synchrony values to see if they match the expected 0-1 range.

The neural synchrony values range from 0.0 to 1.0 as expected, but attention scores are much smaller than the described 0-1 range. This suggests either:
1. The attention scores need to be normalized
2. There was an error in data collection/processing
3. The readme description is inaccurate

Next steps:
1. Create a Python script to:
   - Load and explore the data
   - Check distributions
   - Analyze correlations
   - Create visualizations
2. Write a report with findings

I'll create an analysis script first.

The analysis reveals:
1. Attention scores do span the full 0-1 range (earlier command showed small values because it only printed first/last sorted values)
2. Several region pairs show significant correlations with attention (p-values < 1e-18)
3. The strongest correlation is sync_2_16 (r=0.249)

The script also generated a visualization file 'attention_vs_sync.png' showing:
1. Attention score distribution
2. Scatter plot of attention vs top correlated sync pair

Now I'll create the report.md summarizing these findings.

## Key Findings

1. **Attention Scores**: The attention scores span the full expected range (0 to 1) with a roughly normal distribution.

2. **Significant Correlations**: Several brain region pairs show statistically significant correlations with attention scores (p < 1e-18):

| Region Pair | Correlation (r) | p-value       |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| sync_2_16   | 0.249           | 6.04 × 10⁻²⁷  |
| sync_11_16  | 0.246           | 3.33 × 10⁻²⁶  |
| sync_12_16  | 0.228           | 1.44 × 10⁻²²  |

3. **Visualization**: The relationship between attention and the most correlated synchrony pair (regions 2-16):

![Attention vs Synchrony](attention_vs_sync.png)

## Interpretation

The results suggest that synchrony between certain brain region pairs, particularly those involving region 16, show the strongest predictive relationship with attentional fluctuations. However, the correlations are modest (r ≈ 0.25), indicating synchrony explains only about 6% of the variance in attention scores.

## Limitations

1. The correlations, while statistically significant, are relatively weak in magnitude.
2. The analysis doesn't account for potential temporal dependencies in the time series data.
3. No multiple comparison correction was applied to the p-values.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. Explore time-lagged correlations to assess predictive power
2. Apply machine learning models to predict attention from multiple synchrony pairs
3. Investigate why region 16 appears in multiple top correlated pairs
