## Statistical Interpretation
- The strongest positive association was with gut microbiome composition
- Effect sizes were modest but statistically significant
- Negative lifestyle correlations may reflect confounding variables

## Limitations
- Observational study design
- Multiple comparisons not fully adjusted for
- Small effect sizes

## Conclusion
Tomato consumption shows small but statistically significant associations with specific gut bacteria and metabolic markers. Further controlled studies are needed to establish causation.
