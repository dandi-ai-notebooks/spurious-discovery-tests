## Analysis of Association between Target Variable and Predictor Variables

### Introduction

This report summarizes the findings from an exploratory analysis of the provided time series dataset. The primary objective was to investigate the association between the `target_variable` and the 20 predictor variables over 600 time points.

### Methodology

A Python script (`explore_data.py`) was used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the `target_variable` and each of the predictor variables. To assess the statistical significance of these correlations, a simple linear regression model was fit for each predictor against the target variable, and the p-value for the predictor's coefficient was obtained. A significance level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.

It is important to note that this analysis uses simple correlation and linear regression, which may not fully capture the complex temporal dynamics of time series data. More advanced time series analysis techniques would be required for a comprehensive understanding.

### Results

The analysis revealed the following correlations and their corresponding p-values:

| Predictor Variable | Correlation | P-value | Statistical Significance (Î±=0.05) |
|---|---|---|---|
| metric1_var1 | 0.0442 | 0.2793 | Not Significant |
| metric1_var2 | -0.1257 | 0.0020 | Significant |
| metric1_var3 | -0.1623 | 0.0001 | Significant |
| metric1_var4 | 0.1219 | 0.0028 | Significant |
| metric2_var1 | 0.0593 | 0.1470 | Not Significant |
| metric2_var2 | -0.1912 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric2_var3 | -0.1680 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric2_var4 | 0.1094 | 0.0073 | Significant |
| metric3_var1 | 0.1669 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric3_var2 | -0.0372 | 0.3624 | Not Significant |
| metric3_var3 | 0.1241 | 0.0023 | Significant |
| metric3_var4 | -0.1546 | 0.0001 | Significant |
| metric4_var1 | -0.0630 | 0.1233 | Not Significant |
| metric4_var2 | 0.2687 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric4_var3 | -0.0976 | 0.0168 | Significant |
| metric4_var4 | 0.1351 | 0.0009 | Significant |
| metric5_var1 | 0.2393 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric5_var2 | 0.1695 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric5_var3 | 0.2829 | 0.0000 | Significant |
| metric5_var4 | 0.1357 | 0.0009 | Significant |

### Discussion

Based on a significance level of 0.05, the analysis indicates that a majority of the predictor variables show a statistically significant correlation with the `target_variable`.

Specifically, the following variables demonstrate a statistically significant association:

*   `metric1_var2` (negative correlation)
*   `metric1_var3` (negative correlation)
*   `metric1_var4` (positive correlation)
*   `metric2_var2` (negative correlation)
*   `metric2_var3` (negative correlation)
*   `metric2_var4` (positive correlation)
*   `metric3_var1` (positive correlation)
*   `metric3_var3` (positive correlation)
*   `metric3_var4` (negative correlation)
*   `metric4_var2` (positive correlation)
*   `metric4_var3` (negative correlation)
*   `metric4_var4` (positive correlation)
*   `metric5_var1` (positive correlation)
*   `metric5_var2` (positive correlation)
*   `metric5_var3` (positive correlation)
*   `metric5_var4` (positive correlation)

Variables that did **not** show a statistically significant correlation at the 0.05 level are:

*   `metric1_var1`
*   `metric2_var1`
*   `metric3_var2`
*   `metric4_var1`

The significant correlations vary in strength and direction (positive or negative). The strongest positive correlation was observed with `metric5_var3` (0.2829), while the strongest negative correlation was with `metric2_var2` (-0.1912).

### Conclusion

The exploratory analysis suggests that many of the predictor variables have a statistically significant linear relationship with the `target_variable` over the observed time span. However, given the time series nature of the data, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further analysis using time series specific models is recommended to account for potential autocorrelation, seasonality, or other temporal dependencies that could influence these associations.
