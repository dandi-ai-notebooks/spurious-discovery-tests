# Time Series Analysis Study

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains measurements from a study examining relationships between multiple time series variables. The study collected continuous measurements over 600 time points to investigate temporal patterns and correlations between various metrics.

## Data Collection

Data was collected through:
1. Continuous monitoring system
2. Real-time measurement of multiple metrics
3. Synchronized data collection across all variables

### Variables

1. `target_variable`: Normalized target measurement (0-1)
   - Higher values indicate stronger signal
   - Computed using rolling averages

2. Time Series Metrics (Predictor Variables):
   Measured across four variables (var1, var2, var3, var4):
   - metric1
   - metric2
   - metric3
   - metric4
   - metric5

   Variables are named as `{metric}_{variable}`, e.g.:
   - `metric1_var1`
   - `metric2_var4`

## Research Question

The primary research question this dataset aims to address is:

Is there an association between the target variable and the predictor variables over time?

## Data Format

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/timeseries_data.csv')

# Example structure:
# target_variable | metric1_var1 | metric1_var2 | ... | metric5_var3 | metric5_var4
# 0.75           | -0.5         | 0.2          | ... | 0.4          | 0.8
# ...

I'll create a Python script to analyze the dataset. The script should:

# Time Series Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report presents the analysis of time series data containing various metrics measured across four variables and their relationship with a target variable. The dataset consists of 600 time points with continuous measurements.

## Methodology

The analysis included:
1. Basic statistical analysis of the time series data
2. Correlation analysis between the target variable and predictors
3. Statistical significance testing with FDR correction for multiple comparisons
4. Time series visualization and pattern analysis
5. Stationarity testing of the target variable

## Results

### Time Series Patterns

![Target Variable Time Series](plots/target_timeseries.png)

The above plot shows the behavior of the target variable over time. 

### Correlation Analysis

![Correlation Heatmap](plots/correlation_heatmap.png)

The correlation heatmap visualizes the relationships between all variables in the dataset.

### Top Correlations Over Time

![Top Correlations Time Series](plots/top_correlations_timeseries.png)

This visualization shows the time series patterns of the variables that exhibited the strongest correlations with the target variable.

## Statistical Findings

The results of the statistical analysis can be found in the following files:
- summary_statistics.csv: Contains descriptive statistics for all variables
- correlations.csv: Lists all correlations with the target variable
- statistical_tests.csv: Contains detailed statistical test results including adjusted p-values
- stationarity_test.txt: Results of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for the target variable

Note: The specific numerical results and their interpretations will need to be added after running the analysis script.

## Conclusions

The conclusions will be based on the actual statistical results after running the analysis. This section will be updated with:
- Significant correlations found (if any)
- Time series patterns identified
- Stationarity assessment

## Statistical Findings

### Correlation Analysis

Several significant correlations were identified between the target variable and predictor variables (using FDR-corrected p-values):

Strongest positive correlations:
1. metric5_var3 (r = 0.283, p < 0.001)
2. metric4_var2 (r = 0.269, p < 0.001)
3. metric5_var1 (r = 0.239, p < 0.001)

Strongest negative correlations:
1. metric2_var2 (r = -0.191, p < 0.001)
2. metric2_var3 (r = -0.168, p < 0.001)
3. metric1_var3 (r = -0.162, p < 0.001)

### Stationarity Analysis

The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test results for the target variable:
- ADF Statistic: -5.012
- p-value: 2.10e-05
- Critical values: 
  - 1%: -3.441
  - 5%: -2.866
  - 10%: -2.569

The test results strongly indicate that the target variable is stationary (p < 0.001), as the ADF statistic is more negative than all critical values.

## Conclusions

1. Stationarity: The target variable exhibits stationary behavior, suggesting that its statistical properties (mean, variance) remain constant over time. This is important for the reliability of our correlation analyses.

2. Variable Relationships:
   - The strongest relationship was found with metric5_var3, explaining approximately 8% of the variance (r² = 0.080)
   - metric4_var2 and metric5_var1 also showed moderate positive correlations
   - Several significant negative correlations were identified, particularly with metric2_var2

3. Statistical Significance:
   - Out of 20 predictor variables, 15 showed statistically significant correlations after FDR correction for multiple testing
   - The correlations, while statistically significant, are generally moderate to weak in magnitude
   - The strongest correlation (r = 0.283) suggests that individual predictors explain only a small portion of the target variable's variance

4. Overall Pattern:
   - Metrics from variable group 5 tend to show the strongest positive correlations
   - Variable group 2 shows consistent negative correlations
   - The relationships appear to be complex, with no single predictor dominating the explanation of the target variable's behavior

These findings suggest that while there are clear statistical relationships between the predictors and the target variable, the relationships are relatively weak. This indicates that the target variable's behavior is likely influenced by multiple factors and complex interactions not captured by individual correlations.

I should update the report to include insights from the summary statistics, particularly about the distribution of the target variable and the overall scale of the measurements.

The report is now complete with comprehensive analysis including:
- Correlation analysis with FDR-corrected p-values
- Stationarity testing results
- Visual analysis through plots
- Distribution statistics of both target and predictor variables
- Clear conclusions supported by statistical evidence

Let me make a final attempt at completion.

5. FDR-corrected statistical tests showing 15 out of 20 predictors have significant correlations
6. Detailed analysis of predictor variables' distributions and their relationships with the target variable

The analysis reveals that while there are statistically significant relationships between the predictors and target variable, these relationships are relatively weak, with the strongest correlation explaining only 8% of the variance. The findings suggest that the target variable's behavior is influenced by multiple factors and complex interactions not captured by individual correlations.
