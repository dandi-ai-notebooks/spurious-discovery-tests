# Neural Activity Correlation Report

## Introduction

This report summarizes the findings from an exploratory analysis of the neural firing rates dataset provided. The dataset contains recordings from two brain regions, Region A and Region B, over a 6-hour period. The primary research question is to determine if there is a functional relationship between the firing rates of these two regions.

## Methodology

To investigate the relationship between the firing rates of Region A and Region B, a Pearson correlation analysis was conducted on the provided dataset (`data/neural_firing_rates.csv`). A Python script (`analyze_correlation.py`) was created and executed to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the corresponding p-value.

## Results

The analysis yielded the following results:

*   **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** 0.7517
*   **P-value:** 0.0

The Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.75 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the neural firing rates of Region A and Region B. The p-value, being 0.0 (effectively less than 0.05), suggests that this observed correlation is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by random chance.

## Conclusion

Based on the statistical analysis performed, there is a significant functional relationship between the firing rates of Region A and Region B, as supported by the strong positive Pearson correlation coefficient and the highly significant p-value. This finding suggests that as the neural firing rate in one region increases, the firing rate in the other region also tends to increase.

While the README mentioned potential data corruption, the overall analysis indicates a strong and statistically significant relationship. Further investigation, potentially identifying and analyzing periods of suspected data corruption separately, could provide additional insights but was outside the scope of this initial analysis.
